> There are madeup characters, and then there are madeup characters made up by madeup characters. These notes are dedicated to the memory of Rollo Tomasi (from [L.A. Confidential](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119488/)).


These lecture notes are inspired by the many different books and resources I have used in this course over the years. Especially, "Learning Python the hard way" and "How to think like a computer scientist". Writing my own book allows me to fully implement the following ideas that I think best supports the learning in the initial introduction to programming:

1. Each topic and concept is introduced so that it can be applied right away on top of what you know so far.


2. Introduction of each topic is short so that facts and rules do not down in text. only the most basic facts and rules required to learn the rest by doing practical exercises.

exactly what you need to know

As little text as possible, only the most basic facts and rules required to learn the rest by doing practical exercises. 
3. Only the fundamental parts of Python, no techical coolness, enough to do anything, to focus on the the thinking programming

I would like to improve on these notes as much as I can. So you find errors in exercises, that something is poorly explained, that something is redundant, that something is missing, that something would work better in a different ordrer, please let me know. You can easly do this by reporting an issue [using this link](https://github.com/kaspermunch/bioinf-prog-course/issues).

Happy coding.
