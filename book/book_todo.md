- Add an overview/intro chapter about bioinformatics
- Add easy first chapters on bioinf topics that does not take focus away from programming.
- Move dictionaries and tuples to some weeks later (when needed in programming projects) to quicly move to iteration and programming projects
- Move programmign projects to earlier


- Make some exercises where they get an bit of code and an error message and have to figure otu what the problem is : eg. 

        SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing

        and many others...


- Flere og sværere exercises til første 4 kapitler...
- Flere chapter exercises trying things together
- Sørg for at så mange eksempler som muligt er relateret til molekyklær biologi e.e. {‘ATG’: ‘Met’, …}
- Move section on string formatting after objects and use as example 
- Make variables example much simpler. Just do difference between two things and assign result to new variable. Then elaborate in exercises.

- Put things in a context, for example, don't just have exercises where the result of a function is printed. Also try stuff like:
- Add exercises disinguishing print and return
