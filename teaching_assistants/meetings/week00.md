# Facebook group 
We (one of you) will set up a facebook group so we/you can easily share information/experiences about the teaching/exercises.

We use English in emails and in the facebook group.

# Shared Dropbox folder
- I will invite you to share a Dropbox folder with all the course material that is also relevant to you.
- Inside the Dropbox folder is a folder called BLACKBOARD. The students can see everything you put in there. There is a link to that folder in the left menu on the Blackboard course page.

# The TA job
- Prepare exercises and teach a class
- Correct 3 mandatory assignments
- If some of your students do not hand in their mandatory assignments on time, you will have to spend a bit of time on that even after your classes end.
- Possibly a bit of creating/vetting the exam assignment.
- Vetting/testing of "new" bioinformatics exercises will be distributed among BP TAs.

# Distribution of TAs among classes

- **AP:** Marie, Anne
- **BP:**, Nanna, Erik, Johan, Noor

# Curriculum
- First seven weeks: Lecture notes (I will finish a new version this week with more exercises).
- Last seven weeks: Understanding Bioinformatics (I will buy some copies if need be). I will list the exact curriculum in the coming weeks.

# Exercises
- First seven weeks: Exercises in lecture notes and programming projects.
- Last seven weeks: Programming projects and (reworked) Bioinformatics exercises similar to previous years. I will write the exercises in the coming weeks.

# Weekly turnover of curriculum in the first seven weeks
- Students read lecture notes and do the small exercises.
- I lecture on the same material. I also introduce that weeks programming exercise if there is one.
- Students do remaining exercises and/or programming project related to the material from the previous week. By treating last weeks curriculum in the exercise we are not sensitive to a situation where some classes have exercises before the second lecture. It also lets the students work on each topic for longer time.

# Mandatory exercises
Applied programming:

- Translation project
- Assembly project
- Codon bias project

Bioinformatics and programming:

- Translation project
- Assembly project

# Blackboard
- On Blackboard you will all be registered as Instructors with full editing rights. So please do not edit anything other than what we agree.
- Weekly notes the left menu.
- Left menu also have link to BLACKBOARD Dropbox folder
- Students download assignment files from the Assignment page.
- Assignments for correcting are downloaded from Blackboard and graded (passed/not passed) on Blackboard too.

# Weekly TA meeting
We will have a short weekly TA meeting that you must attend every time. At TA meetings we will evaluate the previous exercise and prepare the next one. Among other things, we will talk about:

- How to outline the programming projects.
- How to help with programming questions.
- How to give hints/help to all a the same time.
- How to introduce and wrap up the we web exercises so the students get all the important take home messages and a proper understanding of the treated topics.
- Preparation of web exercises.
- Correction of mandatory assignments.

# First week
First week's exercises serve mainly to get the students up and running. They install Python and Sublime Text and do exercises. For this exercise you should mainly circulate among the students and help them setting up and solve the initial basic exercises. Please take note of how many of the exercises the students have done by the end of the session.
