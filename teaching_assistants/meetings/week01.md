* TAs should wear class II masks when less than 1 meter from students.
* MO and MM classes are "stamhold" and can sit less than 1 meter appart. AP classes need to enforce 1-meter rule or wear masks.
* For AP2 the room has been changed to 1222-127. With the 1-meter rule there is room for 20 students and there are 23. If the 1-meter rule cannot be enforced students must wear masks.
* Call me on any problems (give me phone numbers so I can see caller id).

## Exercises weeks 8-14

* Can we continue with the current TA assignment?
* Does everyone have a contract on the number of hours they will teach?


## Next weeks exercise (week 1)

Get everyone up and running with Python, the terminal, and sublime text.
Make sure they use the right python exectutable. If they write this command:

	which python
	
Or 

	where python

On windows.

Then it should print a path that ends with with `...conda3/bin/python`. It not, then they did something wrong. Ask if they completed the installation exactly as described if they can think of anything that makes their computer different from everyone else's.

They do the exercises. Free to leave when done or help fellow students.

## Time for regular TA meetings

Last exercise is Thursday 13-16.
How about Fridays 14:00 on Zoom?

## Zoom test

- Microphone sound level ok?
- Are zoom windows hidden?
- Is code legible?
- Can they see pointer?
