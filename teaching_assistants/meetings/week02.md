Corner-cases with operators: [precedence and associativity in Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/precedence-associativity)

If students has questions, try not to provide them with an answer. Instead you can do some of the following to make them realise what they do wrong:

- Ask them questions about their code that makes them realise what they did wrong.
- Make them explain to you what they think their code does.
- Make them figure out by themselves what error messages mean.
- Maybe have them start over and make sure they understand what happens every time they add some code. 
- Maybe have them print values to make sure they have the values they think.
- Refer to the concepts of "Substitution and Reduction" and the fact that python executes one line after each other from top of the file to the bottom.
