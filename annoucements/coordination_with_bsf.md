Coordination with Biomolecular Structure and Function

Hi Students,

The reading material for next week includes instructions for installing Python. Some of you take Ditlev's course Biomolecular Structure and Function where you also need to install Python and PyMol. We have coordinated the installation instructions so they fit both courses: the installation instruction you get from Ditlev is just an abbreviated version of the first two chapters in my lecture notes ("Before you begin" and "Appendix: Conda and PyMol"). You will get the same Python and PyMol installation no matter which of the instructions you follow. My version just has a bit more explanation of each step.

Needless to say, if you do not take the course Biomolecular Structure and Function, you do not need to install PyMol. In that case just follow the instructions in "Before you begin" and skip "Appendix: Conda and PyMol"
