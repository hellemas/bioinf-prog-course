### Reading Material
I will cover the following chapters from the lecture notes (under Curriculum):

- Before you begin
- Writing a program
- Dealing with values
- The order of events

### Lectures
In the first lecture, I will outline how the course is organized, and how you will get the most of your efforts to learn to program. I will also try to give you an intuitive understanding of what programming is and what the world looks like to a computer. 

In the first lecture, I will also talk about how a Python program works, and about values, math, and logic.

In the second lecture, I will talk about variables, substitution, and reduction.

### Exercises
If you have not done so at home, you will install Python and the text editor. To do this, follow the instructions "Before you begin". Then start doing the exercises in the remaining three chapters. You will have time to do these exercises in the TA session of week two as well, so go slow. It is important to properly absorb the basic concepts at the beginning of the course, otherwise, it will become too difficult later on.
