### Lectures
In the first lecture, I will talk about how your code can interact with files on your computer.

In the first lecture, I will also introduce the first programming project.

In the second lecture, I will talk about how to create more complex data structures.

### BP Exercises
This week's exercises are the same as last week. Only MO have their exercises this week. Classes MM classes do not.

### AP Exercises
The topic for this week's exercises is iteration. You are meant to complete all the exercises in the curriculum from last week. You are also meant to complete the programming project "Primer design". There will be lots of work, so do what you can at home and do the rest at the TA session.

### AP Mandatory assignment
The programming project "Primer design" is a mandatory assignment. You can find the project description in the lecture notes and you can download the relevant files under Assignments in the menu on the left. This is also where you submit your assignment. The deadline for submitting the assignment is the night before your exercise next week.
