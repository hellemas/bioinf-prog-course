### Exercises
You are meant to complete the programming project "Codon usage in Streptococcus bacteria". The programming projects are not only meant for the TA sessions. You should work on them at home and get as far as you can before the TA session. That way you can spend the session working on the parts you need help for and then complete the project at home. If you are done with the project before the end of the exercise you will learn a lot from helping your fellow students.

### AP Mandatory assignment
The programming project "Codon usage in Streptococcus bacteria" is a mandatory assignment. You can find the project description in the lecture notes and you can download the relevant files under Assignments in the menu on the left. This is also where you submit your assignment.
