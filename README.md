# Bioinformatics and Programming

This repository contains the teaching material required to teach a practical 14 week undergraduate course in bioinformatics and programming. It is put here to be available to anyone setting up such a course.

## Course description of Qualifications
The participants will after the course have basic knowledge of computer methods and applications for the analysis of biological sequence data as well as insight into principles and techniques for construction of simple programs. Participants will aquire practical experience with analysis of problems in bioinformatics and related fields and with implementation of programs solving such problems using the Python programming language.

The participants must at the end of the course be able to:

* Apply fundamental constructs of a programming language.
* Analyse data and construct data structures for representation of data.
* Analyse simple computational problems and construct programs for their solution.
* Describe and relate key methods in bioinformatics analysis.
* Apply bioinformatics software to biological data.
* Judge the reliability of results obtained using Bioinformatics software.

## Course contents
The course introduces programming and its practical applications in bioinformatics. The course also outlines and discusses bioinformatics algorithms and the most common tools for bioinformatics analysis of sequence data are presented and demonstrated. During the first seven weeks the participant will aquire and train basic programming skills. The last seven weeks introduce key topics in bioinformatics with focus on application of bioinformatical software and aquired programming skills. Subjects for lectures and exercises include: bioinformatics databases, sequence alignment, genome annotation, sequence evolution, phylogenetic analysis.
