# Programming projects

This folder holds all files required for each programming project. Descriptions of projects are in the lecture notes.

Solutions to programming projects are encrypted like this:

    python ../scripts/encrypt.py <encryption key> alignmentproject_solution.py

and can  be decrypted like this:

    python ../scripts/encrypt.py -d <encryption key> alignmentproject_solution.py.encrypted

If you are a teacher you can email me for the encryption key.
