## Notes for chapter 1 {-}

In part I of the exercise, the UCSC "Genes" track has been replaced by "GENCODE v29". If you do not see the "GENCODE v29" track or the "RefSeq Genes" and "Human mRNAs" tracks, scroll down to the drop-down menus under "Gene and Gene Predictions" and select "GENCODE v29" and "NCBI RefSeq". The "Human mRNAs" track can be found under "mRNA and EST". Unfortunately, the GAD view and the Publications track are no longer available.
