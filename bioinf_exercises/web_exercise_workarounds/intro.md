# Fixes for web exercises {-}

The tools and services you will use in the exercises are the actual tools used by researchers. Since Exploring Bioinformatics was published, some of these tools have changed slightly, and some have new names or have been replaced by better services. This means that each exercise may have to be completed in a somewhat different way compared to the description in the book. The notes in this chapter describe any such differences. It also lists links to all tools used in the course.
