## Notes for chapter 11 {-}

For a description of the web exercise see the attached PDF file, which is from Exploring Bioinformatics: A Project-Based Approach 2nd, Caroline St. Clair; Jonathan Visick, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2013, ISBN: 978-1-284-03424-0. A few things have changed since the book was published: 

**Notes for part I:** Under the “Display Files” drop-down menu click “PDB Format” Go to [first glance](https://bioinformatics.org/firstglance/fgij/index.htm) to get to Jmol First Glance Click on the "View" tab to see the different options for displaying the protein. If the right-click menus do not do anything right-click and choose Select>All.

**Notes for part II:** Go to [SWISS-MODEL](https://swissmodel.expasy.org). Click "Start Modeling". On the right side of the page under "Supported Inputs" click "User Template". The HIV sequence and the template can be found in the Dropbox folder. Use the HIV sequence as target sequence and upload the `1odw.pdb` file as template file. Download the result as a PDB file by clicking "Model 01>PDB Format" under "Model Results".

On PDBeFold: Choose PBD entry under "Target" and type in "1KJF". When choosing "PDB entry" Safari might block a pop-up window. You must allow pop-up windows for this website to make it work.

When you do the "View Superposed" part, you have to use a Java applet compatible browser – Internet Explorer should work on Windows (but not Microsoft Edge). If you have Safari 11 or earlier (go to Safari>About Safari), that should also work. However, newer versions of browsers including Safari, Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox no longer supports Java Applets for security reasons. If you are not able to do this part, you can ask your TA for the answer to question 7, so you can continue the exercise. 

**Notes for part III:** Begin the exercise with this part as it can take a quite while. The Fasta file from PDB contains three sequences. Use sequence A. On [PSIPRED](http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/), you have to fill in the "Small identifier" box under submission details. Otherwise you will get an error. It is just a small name for the job you  are running so it can be anything you want.
