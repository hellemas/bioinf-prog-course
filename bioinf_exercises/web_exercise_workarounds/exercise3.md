## Notes for chapter 3 {-}

For a description of the web exercise see the attached PDF file, which is from Exploring Bioinformatics: A Project-Based Approach 2nd, Caroline St. Clair; Jonathan Visick, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2013, ISBN: 978-1-284-03424-0. A few things have changed since the book was published: 

All sequences used in the exercise can be downloaded from the Dropbox folder linked to from Blackboard. You can open these files and copy/paste the sequences into the text area on the web pages or you can upload the file to the web page. 

When the book asks you to compare sequences to the 1918 pandemic virus, it means you should compare to sequence one at a time - not all of them at once.
