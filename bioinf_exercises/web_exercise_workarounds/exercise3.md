## Notes for chapter 3 {-}

All sequences used in the exercise can be downloaded from the Dropbox folder linked to from Blackboard. You can open these files and copy/paste the sequences into the text area on the web pages or you can upload the file to the web page. 

When the book asks you to compare sequences to the 1918 pandemic virus, it means you should compare to sequence one at a time - not all of them at once.
