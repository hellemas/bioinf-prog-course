## Notes for chapter 4 {-}

For a description of the web exercise see the attached PDF file, which is from Exploring Bioinformatics: A Project-Based Approach 2nd, Caroline St. Clair; Jonathan Visick, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2013, ISBN: 978-1-284-03424-0. A few things have changed since the book was published: 

Do not be surprised if the BLAST output is not the same as in the book. The NCBI databases grow every day, so there are new sequences that may show up in your search results.

Do not pick too many sequences from BLAST results because aligning them might take a significant amount of time.

The Clustal alignment server has a limit to the size of the input.  So do not download entire genomes.
