## Notes for chapter 4 {-}

Do not be surprised if the BLAST output is not the same as in the book. The NCBI databases grow every day, so there are new sequences that may show up in your search results.

Do not pick too many sequences from BLAST results because aligning them might take a significant amount of time.

The Clustal alignment server has a limit to the size of the input.  So do not download entire genomes.
