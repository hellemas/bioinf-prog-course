## Notes for chapter 6 {-}

When you download the sequences of $\beta$-casein in part one of the exercise, do not download the entire sequence. Instead, make sure you click on the CDS (Coding Sequence) and download only the coding subsequence. 

In part two of the exercise (Evolutionary Distance in the Mammalian Phylogenetic Tree), you are asked to obtain the phylogenetic distance using different substitution models. If you bought the book second hand, you do not have access to the Evolutionary Distance Calculator tool on the book web site. In that case, you can use the following instructions after downloading the aligned sequences in FASTA format:

1. Go to [http://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/emboss/distmat](http://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/emboss/distmat).
2. Paste or upload the aligned sequences in FASTA format.
3. Select either Jukes-Cantor, Kimura, or Tamura models in the first “Method to use” dropdown menu. (the first dropdown menu is for DNA sequences, the second for protein sequences).
4. Press "Run distmat"
5. Copy the matrix obtained to a text file 
6. Repeat steps 2 - 5 with the other substitution methods
