## Notes for chapter 12 {-}

For a description of the web exercise see the attached PDF file, which is from Exploring Bioinformatics: A Project-Based Approach 2nd, Caroline St. Clair; Jonathan Visick, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2013, ISBN: 978-1-284-03424-0. A few things have changed since the book was published: 

On the NCBI Nucleotide database, you can find HHV complete genome with accession number `X14112.1`. Search for "stable LAT" and save the detected intron sequence in FASTA format to a file (e.g., named "LAT-dna.fasta"). Once you click on "intron sequence," you can click "FASTA" at the bottom of the page to get it FASTA format. 

Transform to RNA using an online tool and save the result to a file (e.g., called LAT-rna.fasta).

You can find links to the "Web primer" and MirEval in the list of links in the beginning of this chapter.

When using MirEval, click the "Genome" and pick "Others" (37th option on the dropdown). When you paste in sequence the sequence, make sure it is correctly formatted as FASTA.
