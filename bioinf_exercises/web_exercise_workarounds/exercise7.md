## Notes for chapter 7 {-}

If you have difficulties finding the FASTA files for the proteins, search them on [UniProt](www.uniprot.org]). The protein for eukaryotes and archaea is called Elongation Factor 1 alpha (EF-1a), the homologous protein in bacteria is called (EF-Tu).

When the book asks you to do agglomerative clustering, you cannot find the fneighbor tool as described in the book, but you can find it at [this location]([http://bioinfo.nhri.org.tw/cgi-bin/emboss/fneighbor).

When producing PhyML and MrBayes trees, you have to click on Phylogeny and change the program you want to use to produce the new trees. You will have to give an email to proceed. This is because these algorithms are computationally intensive and may take a long time for many sequences. However, as you are using small proteins, so it will not take long.

We will not do the exercises in chapter 8.
